## üåü Idea Background

### **Theme**  
Agriculture - **Precision Farming**

### **Problem**  
Farmers often lack the expertise or knowledge required to identify grapevine leaf diseases, leading to reduced crop yields and quality.

### **Solution**  
Develop a deep learning classification model capable of identifying grapevine leaf diseases with high accuracy. The model will classify images of grapevine leaves into four categories to assist farmers with timely and accurate diagnoses.

---

## üìÇ Dataset and Preprocessing

### **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project comprises grapevine leaf images sourced from Kaggle:
- [Grape Disease Dataset (Original)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rm1000/grape-disease-dataset-original)
- [Grape Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pushpalama/grape-disease)

To ensure robust model training, data augmentation techniques were applied to expand the dataset.  
Final dataset split:
- **12,000** training samples  
- **1,805** validation samples  
- **1,805** testing samples  

Find the final processed dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanyeo/grape-vine-leaf-disease).

### **Data Augmentation**  
The following augmentations were applied to improve model performance:
- Horizontal and vertical flipping
- Zooming
- Rotation
- Shearing
- Brightness adjustments

#### Example Augmented Images:
- **Black Rot Disease**

- **Esca Disease**

- **Healthy Leaves**

## üß† Algorithms and Frameworks

### **Frameworks**
We leveraged **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for building the deep learning model due to their:
- Ease of use
- Extensive documentation and community support
- Integrated tools for data preprocessing and augmentation  

Training was conducted using Kaggle's cloud environment for streamlined workflows.

### **Model Architecture**
After testing multiple architectures, including CNN, EfficientNetB7, and MobileNetV2, we selected **ResNet50**:
- Well-suited for medium to large datasets
- High accuracy with moderate computational requirements

#### **Training Configuration:**
- Epochs: **70**
- Batch Size : **16**
- Optimizer: **Adam** with a learning rate scheduler  
- Loss Function: **Categorical Crossentropy**  

### **Model Evaluation**
Model performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- AUC-ROC Curve
